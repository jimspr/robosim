# Building Help for Robosim
To build the help, you need to download "HTML Help Workshop". It doesn't seem to be available on Microsoft's website any longer, but you can find a download if you search.

Launch HTML Help Workshop and select the File|Compile menu item. Specify the robo.hhp file in this directory and press the compile button. This will generate the robo.chm file, which can be checked in.
