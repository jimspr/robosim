<P><B>General Background Information</B></P>

<P>ROBOSIM is a graphical robot simulation package jointly  developed by NASA and Vanderbilt University. Originally developed for DEC VAX systems using Tektronix 4014 or Evan &amp; Sutherland graphics terminals, versions now exist for use on various workstations and the PC. Both DOS and Windows versions have been developed for the PC platform.</P>

<P><B>Dos Version: Features and System Requirements</B></P>

<P>ROBOSIM is used for 3-D geometrical modeling of robot manipulators and various objects in their workspace,  and for the simulation of action sequences performed by the manipulators. Models of robot manipulators, objects, etc. are constructed in ROBOSIM's MODELING ENVIRONMENT. ROBOSIM also provides a SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT where every command entered by the user is executed and the results are displayed on a graphics screen. From this interactive environment users can change the simulated scenario and operate the robot manipulator models previously constructed in the modeling environment.</P>

<P>Features include: Collision Detection, Collision Avoidance, Configuration Management, Composite Objects, and Interface to Real Robots.</P>

<P>System Requirements: A 386, with 387 math coprocessor, or 486 CPU, 2 Mbytes of RAM, and no drivers or TSR's installed that put the system into protected or virtual 8086 mode.</P>

<P><B>Windows Version: Features and System Requirements</B></P>

<P>The Windows version of ROBOSIM (ROBOSIM II 1.4) has been built on the Microsoft Windows NT operating system. ROBOSIM II is a completely new version and shares no code with the original ROBOSIM. ROBOSIM II allows users to write simulations in LISP, instead of a proprieatary language, and it takes advantage of the user-interface provided by Microsoft Windows.</P>

<P>The Windows version provides a very flexible and extensible system. It combines the ease of use of interactive systems with the capabilities and extensibility of a system based on a library of functions. The syntax of all commands is based on LISP. A complete syntax for specifying more complicated objects and robots is provided. This syntax allows specification of: serial and parallel linkages, color, collision detection attributes, constraints on robot parameters, and inverse kinematics. A graphical user-interface, specified using LISP structures, provides access to many of the capabilities of the modeling and simulation system. Using this capability, a user can completely specify a user-interface customized for a particular simulation.</P>

<P>System Requirements:</P>

<P>Recommended hardware for the Windows version is a 486 CPU, or higher, with 16 Mbytes of RAM. Software requirements include Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 or highter or Microsoft Windows 95.</P>
