<P><A NAME="id_whats_new"></A><B>What's New in Version 1.4</B></P>

<P>This version has been updated to build with the latest C++ tools. The code has been cleaned up significantly to use standard C++ types throughout. An issue with inverse kinematics in LISP has been fixed so that it works again. Help has been updated to CHM help.</P>

<P><A NAME="id_whats_new"></A><B>What's New in Version 1.2</B></P>

<P><B>New Features</B></P>

<P>Online help</P>

<P>The standard startup.lsp now provides a way to open and edit files from within ROBOSIM. The <A HREF="robo9hyb.htm">winexec</A> command is used to provide this functionality by starting notepad, which is part of Microsoft Windows.</P>

<P>The "spin" buttons used in several of the dialog boxes now have a nicer, more 3D appearance to them.</P>

<P>Inverse kinematics routines can now be written in LISP. It is still possible to write inverse kinematics routines in "C" and access them through a DLL. This method provides much more speed than that available through an interpreted language. However, it is useful to be able to experiment quickly with inverse kinematics in LISP. Also, there was a limitation of six-degrees-of-freedom manipulators. Now, inverse kinematics can be written for any number of degrees of freedom. It is up to the implementor of the inverse kinematics as to how to handle over- and under-determined systems. See <A HREF="robo8awj.htm">use-kinematics</A> and <A HREF="robo7gkw.htm">use-kinematics-lisp</A> for more information.</P>

<P>Robosim now uses OpenGL for solid models. Flat and smooth (Gouraud) shading are supported. Up to seven lights are allowed and a new dialog allows these to be easily set up.</P>

<P><B>Obsolete Features</B></P>

<P>Robosim no longer supports multiple views or stereoscopic views. Those commands are now obsolete.</P>

<P>Focal length and camera twist settings are no longer supported and do nothing.</P>
